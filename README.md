# 全開 Zenkai

Zenkai is a personal dashboard that automatically visualizes my progress towards
reaching goals in various areas of life.

The name, from Japanese, roughly translates as "full throttle ahead." It's also _kaizen_ (The Toyota Production System's philosophy of constant improvement) reversed.
